Q & A: 
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  - In order to interpret user needs and implement them into a program, it is important to get to know your client and their needs well. Having a positive and clear relationship with your client will help you create the user stories that you are looking for. I believe not just getting to know your client in a business matter but also in a closer human to human relationship will help a lot. It could be hanging out at a golf party or simply having a business meeting at a more relaxed/casual meetup such as a quiet brewery. 
  
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  - When approaching developmend programs, I believe it is important to relax and do a lot of research. It is crucial to have a patient mindset because there will be things that I will not know and find myself in a situation where I won't know how to solve an error. Sometimes taking a break and then coming back to it may help. Watching youtube and doing research regarding the issue could help as well. I think the biggest thing for the future is to be patient and keep trying. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  - A good team member in software development is to not only be good at what you're doing (job wise), but also having a good relationship with your team and everyone around you. It is important to not create or be in a hostile environment. Being able to socialize and keeping a good relationship with your team members can greaty benefit the whole team. It can bring up everyon's moral and positive vibe will always benefit everyone's brains rather than a stressful environment.
